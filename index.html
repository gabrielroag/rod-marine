	  <h3>How it works</h3>
	  <ul>
		<li>Sonihull systems produce multiple bursts of ultrasonic energy 
		in a range of targeted pulse frequencies.</li>
		<li>These pulses are transmitted through the material that the 
		transducer is attached to.</li>
		<li>The ultrasound produces a pattern of increasing and 
		decreasing pressure on the surface of the material.</li>
